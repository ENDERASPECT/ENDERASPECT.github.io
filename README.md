This is a simple single-page cryptocurrency donation website. It's built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Simple Donations**: Displays a static wallet address and QR code for easy donations.
- **ERC-20 Support**: The address can accept ETH and any ERC-20 token on compatible chains (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum).
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first and works on all screen sizes.

## How It Works

The website displays EnderAspect's public cryptocurrency wallet address. Supporters can send donations by:
1.  **Scanning the QR Code** with their mobile wallet app.
2.  **Copying the Wallet Address** and pasting it into their wallet's "send" field.

This method is simple, secure, and supports a wide variety of tokens without requiring users to connect their wallet to the site.
